I have use php(backend) and css(frontend) to develop this web page.
To run the program your system must installed with XAMPP control panel and vscode.
Open Xampp control panel and click on start button for both Apache and MySql module.
Now open any browser in your system and in the url space type localhost/gg //[gg is the name of a file]
Now again open XAMPP control pannel and for MySql module click on admin after web page will get open for data base operations.
On the left hand side there is new button, click on new button after that you have to give the name for your new database and then click on create.
A new data base will be created now you have to put the feilds:-(id, user_name, password, name).
Will create id as primary key.
Then click on save.
Then on the above click on browse button and after that click on insert button.
Now insert username, password and Name you want to store in the database.
Then click on save and now move back to the web page and refresh it and now enter the user id and password you have saved in the data base.
That's all, program will work fine.
